When food is ‘bae’, we can’t resist the eager to search for new recipes and gourmet other fellow foodies are into. Rather than turn to heavy cookbooks, many have turned to online blogs and their much-loved bloggers for those new casserole ideas.

At Bon Appetit you will find a community of food lovers who share delicious recipes that are easy to follow, listicles of food outlets near your locality that serve inexpensive yet mouthwatering food as well as food hubs that are a must visit around the globe for travellers on the go. 

OBJECTIVE:

The user's feed is comprised of posts published by the blogs that they follow. The user can like the posts
that strike a chord with them and based upon the user's likes, the app will recommend other bloggers they
may enjoy as well. The app can also be used to find out where you can find good food in the locale at cheap
prices.

Software Requirements:

        Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
        Backend: Flask
        Database: SQLAlchemy
